        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Orel Butbul, a student at JohnBryce Academy. This project is part of my coursework, and I have put a lot of effort into making it a useful tool for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. I hope you find it informative and easy to use.</p>

        <h1>About Coins Trade World Project</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Coins Trade World Project! This website is a comprehensive platform for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, traders, and anyone interested in the world of digital currencies.</p>
        
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The Coins Trade World Project is a part of my second school project at JohnBryce Academy. It aims to provide users with up-to-date information on various cryptocurrencies, including their current prices, historical data, and other relevant details. The project leverages the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time data about a wide range of cryptocurrencies.</p>
        
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Search Functionality:</strong> Easily search for your favorite coins and get detailed information.</li>
            <li><strong>Coin Details:</strong> View comprehensive details of each coin, including price in multiple currencies, historical data, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Favorites:</strong> Mark up to 5 of your favorite coins for quick access.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
        <p>This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The CoinGecko API is utilized to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data. The project also employs local storage for caching data to enhance performance and reduce the number of API calls.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>In the future, I plan to add more features to this project, including more detailed analytics, historical charts, and integration with additional APIs to provide even more comprehensive data.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for visiting the Coins Trade World Project. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to contact me.</p>
